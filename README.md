# Building a Content-Based Recommender System

### Used exploratory data analysis to study trends across Youtube video categories. I then applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as a TF-IDF model to build various content-based recommender systems. Used cosine similarity to measure similarity among documents.
